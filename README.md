# AnimTheme Text — Three.js Particle Animation Tutorial

This repository contains a hands-on tutorial project for **AnimTheme**, a marketplace where developers and designers sell code, wallpapers, and creative assets.  
The included Three.js demo code teaches you how to create an animated particle system that morphs dynamically between a 3D sphere and text formed with particles.

> This project is part of the AnimTheme Three.js Tutorials series.
